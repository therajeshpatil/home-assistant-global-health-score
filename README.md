## 📄 Abstract
As Home Assistant matures into a mission-critical Smart Home OS, the need for a unified stability metric becomes paramount. **HAGHS** is a logical framework designed to provide an objective **Health Index (0-100)**. It differentiates between transient hardware load and chronic maintenance neglect, providing users with a "North Star" for instance optimization.

---

## 🏗️ The HAGHS Standard (v1.1)

The index is calculated via a weighted average of two core pillars, prioritizing long-term software hygiene over temporary hardware fluctuations.

### The Global Formula

$$Score_{Global} = (Score_{Hardware} \cdot 0.4) + (Score_{Application} \cdot 0.6)$$

---

## 🛠️ Pillar 1: Hardware Performance (40%)

The Hardware Score evaluates the physical constraints of the host machine. It utilizes intelligent thresholding to account for native Linux/Docker overhead.

### Logic & Constraints:
* **CPU Load:** Linear deduction ($0.2$ points per $1\%$ load).
* **Memory Pressure:** Non-linear deduction. Penalties only apply above **70% usage** to respect legitimate reservations from Java-based add-ons and Supervisor overhead.
* **Storage Integrity:** Critical deduction when disk usage exceeds **80%**, escalating as the system nears the 95% "database-locking" threshold.

---

## 🧹 Pillar 2: Application Hygiene (60%)

The Application Score measures the "maintenance debt" of the instance. This is the primary indicator of long-term stability and conflict prevention.

### The "Fair-Play" Engine:
To remain useful for complex environments, HAGHS implements **Penalty Capping**:
* **Zombie Entities:** Unavailable or Unknown entities are scanned across the registry.
* **Domain Filtering:** Legitimate sleepers (e.g., `device_tracker`, `button`, `scene`) are excluded to prevent false negatives.
* **Capping:** The total deduction for "Zombies" is capped at **20 points**, ensuring the score remains actionable even if users have intentional offline devices.
* **Safety Net:** A static **30-point deduction** is applied if the system detects a stale backup state or critical security updates are ignored.

---

## 📋 Implementation Standards

### Naming Convention
To ensure registry organization and prevent automation conflicts, all HAGHS entities follow the professional standard:
`Area: Object - Function` (e.g., `sensor.system_ha_global_health_score`).

### The Advisor Logic
Every HAGHS implementation includes a `recommendations` attribute. This engine parses sub-score failures and provides human-readable, prioritized repair steps.

## 🚀 Deployment & Usage
To implement the HAGHS reference sensor in your instance, follow these steps:

* **Requirements**: Ensure the **System Monitor** integration is active with sensors for **CPU**, **RAM**, and **Disk usage** enabled.

* **Copy Code**: Download the haghs.yaml file from this repository.

* **Integration**: If you use a separate template.yaml, paste the content there (excluding the top-level template: key). If you do not use split config, paste the content directly into your configuration.yaml under the template: heading.

* **Entity Alignment**: Open the code and update the sensor entity IDs in the **Data Collection** and the **recommendations** section to match your system's specific entity names.

* **Reload**: Navigate to **Developer Tools > YAML** and click on **Templates** to initialize the sensor.
