## Abstract
As Home Assistant matures into a mission-critical Smart Home OS, the need for a unified stability metric becomes paramount. **HAGHS** is a logical framework designed to provide an objective **Health Index (0-100)**. It differentiates between transient hardware load and chronic maintenance neglect, providing users with a "North Star" for instance optimization.

---

## The HAGHS Standard (v2.1.1)

The index is calculated via a weighted average of two core pillars, prioritizing long-term software hygiene over temporary hardware fluctuations.

### The Global Formula

$$Score_{Global} = \lfloor (Score_{Hardware} \cdot 0.4) + (Score_{Application} \cdot 0.6) \rfloor$$

*Note: We use **Floor Rounding** (Integer) to ensure a "Perfect 100" is only achieved by truly optimized systems. Even a minor penalty will drop the score to 99.*

---

## Pillar 1: Hardware Performance (40%)

Evaluates the physical constraints of the host machine. It uses tiered penalties to filter out background noise while flagging genuine resource exhaustion.

* **CPU Load (Tiered):** Penalties start at **>10% usage** to ensure responsiveness.
* **Memory Pressure:** Deductions apply above **70% usage** to respect native Supervisor overhead.
* **Storage Integrity:** Critical deduction when disk usage exceeds **80%**, escalating as the system nears the 95% threshold.

---

## Pillar 2: Application Hygiene (60%)

Measures "maintenance debt"—the hidden factors that cause sluggishness, failed backups, and slow restarts.

* **Zombie Entities:** Monitors `unavailable` or `unknown` states (Capped at 20 pts).
* **Database Hygiene:** Penalizes `home-assistant_v2.db` growth (>1GB Warning / >2.5GB Critical).
* **Updates & Core Age:** Tracks pending updates and penalizes a "Core Version Lag" of >2 months.
* **Safety Net:** A static **30-point deduction** for stale backups.

---

## Configuration (The UI Way)

HAGHS is installed as a **HACS Custom Repository** and configured via a **Setup Mask (UI)**. 

### 1. Prerequisites (Prepare your Sensors)

**A. System Monitor:**
Install the **System Monitor** integration. Ensure these specific sensors are **enabled**:
* `sensor.processor_use` (Percentage %)
* `sensor.memory_use_percent` (Percentage %)
* `sensor.disk_use_percent_home` (Percentage %)

**B. Database Sensor (SQLite / Standard):**
To allow Home Assistant to see its own database size, add this to your `configuration.yaml` and restart:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  allowlist_external_dirs:
    - "/config"
```

**After the restart:**
1.  Go to **Settings > Integrations > Add Integration**.
2.  Search for **File Size** and set the path to: `/config/home-assistant_v2.db`.

*Note: For MariaDB/Postgres, create a SQL sensor that returns the size in MB.*

### 2. Installation & Setup
1.  Add this repo to **HACS** (Custom Repository, Category: Integration).
2.  Download and **Restart Home Assistant**.
3.  Go to **Settings > Integrations > Add Integration** and search for **HAGHS**.
4.  Follow the setup mask to select your sensors. 

**⚠️ Log File Deprecation:** We are phasing out Log File monitoring to streamline the integration. In the setup mask, please **leave the log file field empty** to skip this check.

---

## Label Configuration (Smart Whitelisting)
To prevent false positives from sleeping tablets or seasonal devices:
1.  Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Labels**.
2.  Create a label named `haghs_ignore`.
3.  Assign this label to any **Device** or **Entity**. 
    * **Pro Tip:** Assigning the label to a **Device** automatically whitelists **all underlying entities** belonging to that specific device.

## UI Integration Example

Recommended configuration for a clean frontend display:

```yaml
type: vertical-stack
cards:
  - type: gauge
    entity: sensor.system_ha_global_health_score
    name: HAGHS
    needle: true
    severity:
      green: 90
      yellow: 75
      red: 0
  - type: markdown
    content: >
      **🛡️ Advisor Recommendations:** {{
      state_attr('sensor.system_ha_global_health_score', 'recommendations') }}

      {% set z_list = state_attr('sensor.system_ha_global_health_score',
      'zombie_entities') %} {% if z_list and z_list != 'None' %} **⚠️ Zombie
      Entities:** {{ z_list.split(',') | count }} detected *(Check attributes to
      see full list)* {% endif %}
```
